## 1. Description of dataset (Raw data)



```{r 1.1 loading data}
#loading "RDeeP_A549_NS.csv" into Data.raw dataframe
#MS_Table <- read.table("c://khalida//desktop//2022-topic-03-team-04//RDeeP_A549_NS.csv", header=TRUE, row.names=1, sep = ";")
Data.raw <- read.table("~/Desktop/2022-topic-03-team-04/RDeeP_A549_NS.csv", header=TRUE, row.names=1, sep = ";")


#creating a copy of Data.raw and saving it as Data.copy
Data.copy = Data.raw

```


```{r 1.2 Raw data reorganization}


```



```{r}
# RNA associates with proteins to form RNA-Protein complexes that play key regulatory roles in cellular processes --> RNA metabolism and the regulation of gene expression 

# concept of RNA dependence (R-DeeP) describes proteins and protein complexes whose interactions are directly or indirectly dependent on the presence of RNA 



# aim: identify RNA-dependent proteins from the position of the proteins in an untreated cell lysate as t
```

## 1. Evaluation of the reproducibility of the experiments 


## 2. Normalization

## 3. Peaks identification

## 4. Fit of the protein profiles

## 5.
