# RNA associates with proteins to form RNA-Protein complexes that play key regulatory roles in cellular processes --> RNA metabolism and the regulation of gene expression 

# concept of RNA dependence (R-DeeP) describes proteins and protein complexes whose interactions are directly or indirectly dependent on the presence of RNA 



# aim: identify RNA-dependent proteins from the position of the proteins in an untreated cell lysate as t
