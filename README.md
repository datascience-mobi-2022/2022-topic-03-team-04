### Working with GitHub Desktop
> We used GitHub Desktop in order to make real-time parallel working and collaboration possible. (https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop)

## Table of Content
- Source code 
- PDF report
- Folder Names 
  1) Data folder
  2) Final folder
  3) Paper folder
  4) Proposal folder
  5) Results Folder

> The goal of the project is to analyse the results of mass spectrometry. The acquired proteins should be checked for RNA dependency. The RNA-dependent proteins should be determined automatically with the analysis. The analysis includes following steps: Data restructuring, normalization, global and local maxima detection, choosing selection criteria, linear regression and further analysis. 

### 1. Data Folder 
This folder contains the raw data by Maiwen Caudnon-Herger (RDeeP_A549_NS.csv), as well as the normalised data of the Crtl and RNAse group (Norm_Ctrl.rds, Norm_RNase.rds) and the external data for comparison (table_RBP_lists.csv, HS_RBPs.RData). 
- [HS_RBPs.RData] - The file was given by tutor Niklas Engel 
- [table_RBP_lists.csv] - The file was taken from the RDeep-website (https://r-deep.dkfz.de/)

### 2. Final folder 
In this folder you will find the final presentation (DatenAnalyseSS22_finalpr√§si.pptx), the cover of the presentation (Cover.png) and the finished report in Rmd format (Final Report .Rmd).

### 3. Paper folder 
The paper folder has the summary of the papers (Article Review 1.docx, Article Review 2 and 3.docx) explaining the biological background. The folder also has the summary of the RNA-dependent proteins found (RNA dependent Protein.docx). This file shows four RNA-dependent proteins that can affect lung cancer. 

| RNA-dependent proteins (lung cancer) | biological background|
| ------ | -------|
| PAPD1_HUMAN | Catabolic process of histone mRNA, mRNA polyadenylation|
| CIRBP_HUMAN| Stress reaction |
| TOP2A_HUMAN | Biological rhythms  |
| IF5A1_HUMAN |mRNA transport, proteinsynthesis, translocation, transport  |


### 4. Proposal folder
This folder contains the first finished presentation for our project proposal from 17.05.2022 (DatenAnalyseSS22_final.pptx). 

### 5. Results folder
The folder has all the pictures of the results (png) and the results in txt format (txt).
